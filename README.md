# Library-Management-System
# Project Overview
The Library Management System is a simple database-driven project built using SQL (SQLite) and a minimal Python interface. The goal of this project is to provide an efficient way to store, manage, and track books, members, and loan transactions in a library environment.
The project focuses on the core SQL concepts such as table design, relationships, CRUD operations, joins, transactions, and reporting queries. The system supports basic library operations such as issuing books, returning books, tracking overdue books, and viewing member loan history.
It is lightweight, easy to run locally, and ideal for learning database concepts or showcasing SQL skills on GitHub.
# Problem Statement
Libraries often face challenges in maintaining records manually, such as difficulty tracking borrowed books, managing inventory, and checking overdue returns. Manual systems are slow, error-prone, and not scalable.
To address this, an automated system is required that uses a structured database to store and retrieve information efficiently, enabling accurate tracking of books and members.
# Objectives
To design and implement a relational database for library management.
To perform CRUD operations on books, authors, members, and loans.
To handle book issuing and returning using SQL transactions.
To generate useful reports such as overdue books and member history.
To provide a simple Python interface to interact with the SQL database.
# Features
Lightweight and easy to run on any computer
Clear relational schema
Safe lending/returning using transactions
Automatic update of available copies
Overdue book detection
Suitable for academic submission
Great for learning SQL + Python integration
# Technologies Used
SQL (SQLite) — database engine
Python 3 — for CLI-based application
SQL operations: joins, constraints, transactions
